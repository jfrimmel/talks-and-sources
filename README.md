# Insightful talks and papers
This repository contains a list of links to papers or conference talks.
They are grouped in various categories.

The reader may find various interesting and insightful information here, that may improve the code quality one writes or the tool knowledge one has.

The target audience is basically everyone with interests like myself, i.e. the topics in this list include Rust, C, C++, some Java and other programming languages as well as architecture-talks on x86, ARM, GPUs, etc.
There are design patterns and other design and infrastructure topics as well.

## Contribution
Feel free to open a PR or issue with links to other talks and papers.
I will view them and possibly include them in this list, if I think, that this is a good fit.
